        <p1>I should've stayed at home<br>
            Cause right now I see all these people that love me<br>
            But I still feel alone<br>
            Can't help but check my phone<br>
            I could've made you mine<br>
            But no, it wasn't meant to be and see, I wasn't made for you<br>
            And you weren't made for me<br>
            Though it seemed so easy<br>
            <br>
            And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy<br>
            I wanna be the one that makes your day<br>
            The one you think about as you lie awake<br>
            I can't wait to be your number one<br>
            I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine<br>
            But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry<br>
            <br>
            But won't you wait?<br>
            You know it's too late<br>
            I'm on my own shit now<br>
            Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great<br>
            I feel great<br>
            Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
            You need to be yourself<br>
            Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool<br>
            That makes your heart melt<br>
            Who knows what you truly felt?<br>
            You're still my favorite girl<br>
            You better trust me when I tell you<br>
            There ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world<br>
            In this damn world<br>
            <br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend<br>
            I said that<br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend, best friend<br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend<br>
            Best friend<br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
            You're gonna wanna be my best friend<br>
            <br>
            I say that I'm happy<br>
            I say that I'm happy<br>
            But no, no, no, no<br>
            No, no, no<br>
            <br>
            Oh, I still wanna be your favorite boy<br>
            I wanna be the one that makes your day<br>
            The one you think about as you lie awake<br>
            And I can't wait to be your number, your number one<br>
            I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine<br>
            But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry<br>
            <br>
            I still wanna be your favorite boy<br>
            I wanna be the one<br>
            I might just be the one</p1></center>
