        <h2>Lirik</h2>
        <p1>If I had a gun<br>
            I'd shoot a hole into the sun<br>
            And love would burn this city down for you<br>
            If I had the time<br>
            I'd stop the world and make you mine<br>
            And every day would stay the same with you<br>
            <br>
            Give you back a dream<br>
            Show you now what might have been<br>
            For the tears you cried will fade away<br>
            I'll be by your side<br>
            When they come and say goodbye<br>
            We will live to fight another day<br>
            <br>
            Excuse me if I spoke too soon<br>
            My eyes have always followed you around the room<br>
            'Cause you're the only god that I will ever need<br>
            I'm holding on<br>
            And waiting for the moment to find me<br>
            <br>
            Hope I didn't speak too soon<br>
            My eyes have always followed you around the room<br>
            'Cause you're the only god that I will ever need<br>
            I'm holding on<br>
            And waiting for the moment for my heart to be unbroken by the seams<br>
            <br>
            Let me fly you to the moon<br>
            My eyes have always followed you around the room<br>
            'Cause you're the only god that I will ever need<br>
            I'm holding on<br>
            And waiting for the moment to find me<br>
            <br>
            If I had a gun<br>
            I'd shoot a hole into the sun<br>
            And love would burn this city down for you</p1></center>
